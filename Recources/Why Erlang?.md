##Why Erlang?

#### High-Level Constructs 

Erlang is a declarative language. 

which means it describes what should be computed, not how this computation is calculated. 

Another aspect of Erlang is that functionsare first-class data. 

They can be bound to a variable and can be treated just like any other data item: stored in a list, returned by a function, or communicated between processes.


#### Concurrent Processes and Message Passing 

One of main reasons that make Erlang a very powerful programming language is its support or Concurrency.

Each Erlang process executes in its own memory space and owns its own heap and stack instead of using threads that share memory.

Processes can’t conflict with each other which leads to deadlocks ,race condition and other problems of concurrency .

Processes communicate with each other via message passing.

Note : message can be any kind of Erlang data type. 

Message passing is asynchronous, so once a message is sent, the process is not blocked . it can continue processing. 

What makes the concurrency more powerful is that :

Messages are retrieved from the process mailbox selectively. 

It is not obligatory to process messages in the order they are came to the mailbox.


####Scalable, Safe, and Efficient Concurrency 

Erlang concurrency is fast and scalable. 

The processes are lightweight .Its even lighter than thread.

processes are created, scheduled, and handled in the VM, independent of the operating system. Therfore, process creation time is so small . 

Erlang processes communicate with each other through message passing. Regardless of the number of concurrent processes in your system, exchanging messages within the system takes *microseconds*.

All that is involved in message passing is the copying of data from the memory space of one process to the memory space of the other, all within the same virtual machine. 


#### Soft Real-Time Properties 

Erlang can be used  for tasks with soft real-time constraints. 

Erlang can handle high loads with no declination in throughput , and the reason is 

Storage management in Erlang is automated, with garbage collection im- plemented on a per-process basis. 

This gives system response times on the order of milliseconds even in the presence of garbage-collected memory.


#### Robustness 

• Erlang processes can be linked together so that if one crashes, the other will be knowing, and then can either handle the   crash or choose to crash itself.

• OTP provides a number of generic behaviors, such as servers, finite state machines, and event handlers. 

• These generic behaviors are linked to a **supervisor** behavior whose only task is to monitor and handle process termination.

• Using this supervision and linking, Erlang programmers can concentrate on pro- gramming for the correct case, and can let the process fail in any other circumstan- ces. 


#### Distributed Computation 

Erlang has distribution incorporated into the language’s syntax and semantics.

The default distribution mode is based on **TCP/IP** , allowing a node to connect to any other node running on any operating system. 

As long as these nodes are connected through a TCP/IP network , the result is a fully meshed network of nodes, where all the nodes can communicate with each other.

With distribution built into the language ,you can easily distribute your processes across a cluster of computers because the  syntax of sending a message within a local node is the same as sending it to a remote node.


#### Integration and Openness

Erlang is an open language allowing you to integrate legacy code or new code .
 
Therfore, there are mechanisms for interworking with C, Java, Ruby, and other programming languages, including Python, Perl, and Lisp.

External languages can be added using drivers that are linked into the Erlang runtime system .

High-level libraries allow Erlang nodes to communicate with nodes executing Java or C, 

making them appear and behave like  distributed Erlang nodes.
