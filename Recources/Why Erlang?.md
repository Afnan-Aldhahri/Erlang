##Why Erlang?

#### High-Level Constructs 

Erlang is a declarative language. 

which means it describes what should be computed, not how this computation is calculated. 

Another aspect of Erlang is that functionsare first-class data. 

They can be bound to a variable and can be treated just like any other data item: stored in a list, returned by a function, or communicated between processes.


#### Concurrent Processes and Message Passing 

One of main reasons that make Erlang a very powerful programming language is its support or Concurrency.

Each Erlang process executes in its own memory space and owns its own heap and stack instead of using threads that share memory.

Processes canâ€™t conflict with each other which leads to deadlocks ,race condition and other problems of concurrency .

Processes communicate with each other via message passing.

Note : message can be any kind of Erlang data type. 

Message passing is asynchronous, so once a message is sent, the process is not blocked . it can continue processing. 

What makes the concurrency more powerful is that :

Messages are retrieved from the process mailbox selectively. 

It is not obligatory to process messages in the order they are came to the mailbox.


####Scalable, Safe, and Efficient Concurrency 

Erlang concurrency is fast and scalable. 

The processes are lightweight .Its even lighter than thread.

processes are created, scheduled, and handled in the VM, independent of the operating system. Therfore, process creation time is so small . 

Erlang processes communicate with each other through message passing. Regardless of the number of concurrent processes in your system, exchanging messages within the system takes *microseconds*.

All that is involved in message passing is the copying of data from the memory space of one process to the memory space of the other, all within the same virtual machine. 


#### Soft Real-Time Properties 

Erlang can be used  for tasks with soft real-time constraints. 

Erlang can handle high loads with no declination in throughput , and the reason is 

Storage management in Erlang is automated, with garbage collection im- plemented on a per-process basis. 

This gives system response times on the order of milliseconds even in the presence of garbage-collected memory.


#### Robustness 

#### Distributed Computation 

#### Integration and Openness
