## What kind of applications is Erlang particularly suitable for ?

##### Distributed, reliable, soft real-time concurrent systems.

* Telecommunication systems, e.g. controlling a switch or converting protocols.

* Servers for Internet applications, e.g. a mail transfer agent, an IMAP-4 server, an HTTP server or a WAP Stack.

* Telecommunication applications, e.g. handling mobility in a mobile network or providing unified messaging.

* Database applications which require soft realtime behaviour.

Erlang is very powerful at solving these kinds of problems because this is the domain it was originally designed for since Erlang has these characteristics:

* Concurrency and message passing are a essential characteristics of Erlang. 

* Applications written in Erlang contain thousands of lightweight processes. 

* Erlang provides a simple model for fault tolerance .

*  distributed applications is so easy. 

* The OTP libraries provide support for many common problems in networking and telecommunications systems.
