##The History of Erlang

####1982 - 1985
using 20 different languages >>experiments with programming of telecom . 

Ex: Lisp , Prolog , Parlog 


####1985 - 86
the execution model must be free of back-tracking , and the language must has  concurrency and error recovery .
So,they musthave developed a language with the above recommendable features of Lisp, Prolog and Parlog, but with concurrency and error recovery built into the language.


####1987
The first experiments with Erlang.


####1988
ACS/Dunder Phase 1. Prototype construction of PABX functionality by external users Erlang escapes from the lab!


####1989
ACS/Dunder Phase 2. Reconstruction of 1/10 of the complete MD-110 system.

Results: >> 10 times greater gains in efficency at construction compared with construction in PLEX!

more experiments with a fast implementation of Erlang.


####1990
Erlang is presented at ISS'90, which results in several new users, e.g Bellcore.


####1991
Fast implementation of Erlang is released to users. 

Erlang is represented at Telecom'91 . 

More functionality such as ASN1 - Compiler , graphical interface etc.


####1992
A lot of new users, e.g several RACE projects.

Erlang is ported to VxWorks, PC, Macintosh etc. 

Three applications using Erlang are presented at ISS'92. 

The two first product projects using Erlang are started.


####1993
Now it possible to run a homgeneous Erlang system on a heterogeneous hardware because distribution is finally added to Erlang.

Decision to sell implementations Erlang externally.

Separate organization in Ericsson started to maintain and support Erlang implementations and Erlang Tools.
