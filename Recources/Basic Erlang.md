##Basic Erlang

##### Integers

Integers in Erlang are used to denote whole numbers.

They can be positive or negative. 

The only limit on how large an integer can become depends on the physical constraints of the machine, namely the available memory.

Some examples of integers include:
âˆ’564 0 11 700000000

To express integers in a base other than 10, the Base#Value notation is used.

To express characters as ASCII values, the $Character notation is used.

$Character returns the ASCII value of Character.

$a represents the integer 97 and $A represents the integer 65. 

The ASCII value representation of a newline, $\n, is 10:
$a $A $\n
