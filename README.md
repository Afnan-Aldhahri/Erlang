# Erlang

If you are new to **Erlang** , this presentation will give you an overview picture of **Erlang** and how its related to software Engineering .

After you finish reading this repository , you will be able to write , complie ,run , test an effictive Erlang code.

and most importantly , you will know why choosing **Erlang** .

We will start *together* this journey, since **Erlang** is a *new* programming language for me too.
